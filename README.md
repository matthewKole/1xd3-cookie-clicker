Caden and I made this cookie clicker inspired game for our 1xd3 Javascript assignment. It has a hades underworld theme where you click to collect souls, instead of cookies.
It has all the bells and whistles when it comes to javascript including classes, objects, functions etc. I learned a lot about modular design and we hope you enjoy!
